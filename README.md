Haus Noir — Cognitive Game Profiling for Modern Players

Haus Noir is a tech-modern play-profiling engine built to rethink how players discover games. Traditional stores rely on genres, tags, or sales charts — signals that flatten individuality and bury smaller, soulful titles under algorithms. Haus Noir takes a different approach: it learns you.

At the core of Haus Noir is a series of minimal, elegant micro-challenges that capture how you think and react. These tests measure cognitive patterns such as reflex speed, strategic planning, adaptability, risk sensitivity, focus depth, and problem-solving style. Every interaction feeds a lightweight behavioral model that generates your Cognitive Signature — a unique profile that describes your natural play tendencies with clarity and nuance.

Using this signature, Haus Noir matches players with games that align with their inherent instincts rather than superficial categories. A fast, decisive thinker receives different recommendations than a slow, methodical strategist. Explorers discover titles built around discovery and narrative texture, while pattern-hunters get deep systems, roguelikes, and progression loops.

Behind the scenes, Haus Noir integrates modern embeddings, TasteRay signals, and store APIs to pull accurate metadata from Steam, Epic, and other libraries. The system merges your personal cognitive fingerprint with real game mechanics, creating a recommendation layer that feels intentional and human — not statistical or generic.

The experience is designed to feel premium and effortless:

A clean, modern UI that behaves like a design object rather than a store.

Interactive visualizations of your Cognitive Signature.

A discovery feed that changes dynamically as your profile evolves.

“Why This Game?” cards that explain matches in transparent, relatable terms.

Haus Noir is not just a discovery tool — it’s a mirror. It helps you understand the kind of player you are, and it opens paths to games you might never have found on your own. In a world overwhelmed by content, Haus Noir brings precision, personality, and a sense of quiet sophistication to the way we play.

More than recommendation — this is self-discovery through gameplay.
